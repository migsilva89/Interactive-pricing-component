# Interactive Pricing Component

Challenge from [Front End Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-pricing-component-t0m8PIyY8/hub/interactive-pricing-component-SJWhkFs7q).

This is an interactive pricing component that changes the values with range input + monthly or yearly.

Was made with HTML5 + TAILWIND POSTCSS + JAVASCRIPT 

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install Tailwind and PostCSS.

```bash
npm install ...
```

## What I learned:

- I learned how to manipulate data with a range value and change all the values from the range with a click. 
- How to install and setup Tailwind PostCss

Tips or advice on how to improve are very welcome, thank you all!
